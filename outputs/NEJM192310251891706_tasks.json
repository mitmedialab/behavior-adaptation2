      "behavior_rationale": "For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'highly_proactive' with a proactive_score of 1.0 (within the 0.8-1.0 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'identifying and interpreting a conflict between acute presentation and chronic anatomical findings', requires the AI to actively detect inconsistencies and infer a more complete understanding of the patient's medical history than is immediately apparent. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.8) would likely overlook the subtle clues indicating pre-existing conditions, focusing solely on the acute presentation and missing the opportunity to connect disparate pieces of information. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., prematurely jumping to unsupported conclusions about specific undiagnosed conditions) might lead to unsubstantiated hypotheses, distracting from the core objective of identifying the conflict and suggesting a reasonable alternative explanation. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent synthesizing information from the History of Present Illness and the Anatomical Diagnosis to highlight the discrepancy, suggesting that the acute event occurred against a backdrop of chronic disease. This aligns with the role of a medical AI assistant designed to enhance clinical understanding and diagnostic accuracy by identifying subtle but significant conflicts in patient data. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'detecting omissions/conflicts' and 'resolving ambiguity', are directly applicable here, as the agent must actively identify the incongruence and suggest a possible resolution by inferring pre-existing conditions. The task is broadly categorized as 'proactive_data_conflict_resolution' due to its focus on identifying and interpreting disagreements or notable contrasts between different data points in a patient's medical record."

This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, evaluating a historical clinical narrative for potential diagnostic omissions in the context of Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF), requires the AI to actively detect subtle omissions in the described clinical evaluation relative to established diagnostic criteria, even considering the historical understanding of ARF. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.6) would likely focus only on the explicitly mentioned symptoms (chorea and carditis) and fail to recognize the absence of documentation regarding other potential ARF manifestations (polyarthritis, erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules), thus missing critical diagnostic considerations. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., speculating on alternative diagnoses beyond ARF without sufficient evidence) could introduce irrelevant information and distract from the core objective of assessing the completeness of the ARF evaluation. The optimal behavior involves the AI agent cross-referencing the presented clinical narrative with the diagnostic criteria for ARF as understood at the time (or inferred from the text) to identify potential gaps in the documented assessment, highlighting areas where the clinical picture may be incomplete.

      "behavior_rationale": "For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'highly_proactive' with a proactive_score of 1.0 (within the 0.8-1.0 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'evaluating the impact of a diagnostic constraint on clinicopathological correlation', requires the AI to actively identify and assess the implications of a significant omission in the diagnostic process, going beyond simply acknowledging its existence. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.6) would likely fail to fully appreciate the limitations imposed by the lack of head examination during autopsy, leading to a superficial understanding of the case's diagnostic challenges. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., generating hypothetical findings from the unexamined head) might introduce unsubstantiated information and detract from the established findings. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent synthesizing the clinical presentation (severe chorea), the known pathophysiology of similar conditions (Sydenham's chorea and basal ganglia involvement), and the specific diagnostic limitation (no head examination) to infer the impact on the completeness of the clinicopathological correlation, and thus highlighting the limitation's impact on case understanding. This aligns with the role of a medical AI assistant designed to enhance clinical insight and knowledge synthesis by identifying potential knowledge gaps and limitations in diagnostic procedures. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'detecting omissions/conflicts, evaluating hypothetical errors, complex prediction, resolving ambiguity', are directly applicable here, as the AI is expected to detect the omission of the head examination, evaluate its impact as a hypothetical error in diagnostic procedure, and make a complex prediction as to how this affected the correlation of clinical symptoms to pathology. The task is broadly categorized as 'proactive_standard_of_care' due to its focus on evaluating diagnostic procedures."

Ethically, while respecting family wishes regarding autopsy is important, historically, autopsies, especially in fatal cases of poorly understood diseases like this, were vital for advancing medical knowledge.

      "behavior_rationale": "For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'highly_proactive' with a proactive_score of 1.0 (within the 0.8-1.0 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'detecting inconsistencies between the patient's reported acute history and the autopsy findings of chronic lung pathology', requires the AI to actively identify and evaluate a potential data conflict rather than simply reporting the given information. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.8) would likely fail to recognize the discrepancy between the rapid symptom onset and the evidence of long-standing disease, missing a critical insight that could impact the interpretation of the case. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., attempting to definitively diagnose the cause of the discrepancy without additional information) might lead to premature conclusions and detract from the AI's role as a supportive tool. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent thoroughly evaluating the timeline of symptoms and comparing it to the expected progression of tuberculosis pathology, highlighting the significance of the discrepancy and raising pertinent questions about potential inaccuracies in the history or underlying chronic conditions. This aligns with the role of a medical AI assistant designed to enhance clinical vigilance and provide comprehensive decision support by identifying inconsistencies and prompting further investigation. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'detecting omissions/conflicts, evaluating hypothetical errors, complex prediction, resolving ambiguity', are directly applicable here as the AI is expected to identify a conflict in the data, evaluate the implications of this conflict, and make predictions about possible explanations for the discrepancy. The task is broadly categorized as 'proactive_data_conflict_resolution' due to its focus on identifying and evaluating disagreements between different pieces of clinical information to improve the accuracy and completeness of the case understanding."

Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.97) in this context might lead to unfounded assumptions about other underlying conditions without sufficient evidence. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent actively inferring the link between involuntary movements and skin breakdown, interpreting the location of the skin findings in relation to typical choreic movements, and then using this interpretation to inform the overall assessment of symptom severity.

A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely simply reiterate the explicitly stated reasons for sedation (controlling motions and exhaustion) without grasping the severity of the chorea and the limited treatment options available at the time, thus failing to provide a complete or insightful answer. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might speculate on alternative, unmentioned treatments or question the historical accuracy of the case report, exceeding the bounds of the provided information and potentially introducing irrelevant or misleading information. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent cross-referencing the patient's presentation with general medical knowledge about the dangers of severe chorea and the limited treatment options available during the relevant time period to understand why aggressive sedation, despite its risks, was considered a necessary intervention. This aligns with the role of a medical AI assistant designed to provide historical context and support clinical reasoning by highlighting the trade-offs inherent in medical decision-making. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'requires retrieval AND inference/synthesis across sections', are directly applicable here as the AI needs to retrieve specific reasons for sedation from the text and synthesize them with external knowledge of severe chorea complications. The task is broadly categorized as 'reactive_ddx_reasoning' due to its focus on interpreting diagnostic data and therapeutic interventions within a specific clinical context to understand the rationale behind medical decisions."

This systematic approach, even with limited information, prioritizes infectious etiologies based on the acute, likely fatal course in a child.\nE: Dr. Cabot is primarily prioritizing potential causes based on the major organ systems commonly affected by rapid and fatal diseases in children, such as pulmonary, neurological, or hematologic.\nF: Dr. Cabot is prioritizing toxicological causes over infectious etiologies as the most probable explanation for a rapid and fatal illness in a child based on the initial presentation and duration.\n\nChoose the single best option (A, B, C, D, E, F) and provide a detailed step-by-step rationale for your choice, explaining why it is correct and why the others are incorrect based on the provided context and clinical reasoning.\n\n=== YOUR RESPONSE ===\nSelected Option: [Your Choice: A, B, C, D, E, F or N/A if free response]\nRationale: [Your detailed step-by-step reasoning]",

      "behavior_rationale": "For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'balanced' with a proactive_score of 0.52 (within the 0.4-0.6 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, \"analyzing and abstracting the core diagnostic principles implicitly guiding a physician's initial assessment,\" requires the AI to actively synthesize information to identify underlying reasoning patterns rather than just passively reporting stated facts. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely fail to recognize the implicit application of probabilistic reasoning and elimination, resulting in a superficial understanding of the diagnostic process. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might lead to over-interpreting the physician's thought process or attributing diagnostic strategies that were not actually employed. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent abstracting the key features of the case (age, gender, rapid fatality) and connecting them to the physician's actions (dismissing or downplaying certain conditions) to identify the implicit application of probabilistic reasoning and elimination. This aligns with the role of a medical AI assistant designed to enhance clinical reasoning by making expert thought processes more transparent and accessible. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as \"requires retrieval AND inference/synthesis across sections,\" are directly applicable here, as the LLM must retrieve details of the case and then synthesize them to understand the principles driving diagnostic reasoning.
